Dear [Principal Name],

I wanted to share information about LessonPlan AI, a platform designed to save teachers 10+ hours weekly on lesson planning while helping identify at-risk students before they fail.

**Attached you'll find:**
1. A detailed presentation (PDF/PowerPoint) showing how it works

**Perfect for your school's:**

- After-school tutoring (export priority student lists)
- Lesson plan submission requirements
- Data-driven improvement initiatives

**I'd love to schedule a quick 15-minute demo** to show you how [School Name] could benefit. We're offering a **30-day free trial with no credit card required**.
